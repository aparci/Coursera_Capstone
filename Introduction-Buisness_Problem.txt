In a city of your choice, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it? Similarly, if a contractor is 
trying to start their own business, where would you recommend that they setup their office?
These are just a couple of many ideas and problems that can be solved using location data in addition to other datasets. No matter what you decide
to do, make sure to provide sufficient justification of why you think what you want
to do or solve is important and why would a client or a group of people be interested in your project.

1. Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute.
Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure 
that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

This submission will eventually become your Introduction/Business Problem section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the 
report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.




2. Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare 
location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. 
So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

This submission will eventually become your Data section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Data section) to 
your Github repository and submit a link to it.
