INTRODUCTION / BUISNESS PROBLEM

The problem that I will solve is related with restaurants in New York. Someone is looking to open a reastaurant and I need to recommend where to
open it and what kind of reastaurant should it be. First I need to emphasize that client wants to open restaurant on Manhattan so I need to find 
only restaurants on Manhattan using the Foursquare location data for analysis. I will give a proposal to client where it would be the best to open
certain type of restaurant, so my analysis will be about type of food that restaurant will be serving and place where it should be opened. I will
do analysis so that I will recommend client to open, for example, an italian restaurant in area where there is not any good rated italian restaurant 
so that it has more chances for success in the beginning.
